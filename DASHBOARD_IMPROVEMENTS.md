# Dharma Dashboard Modernization & Innovation Plan

## Vision
Reimagine the Dharma dashboard as a vibrant, interactive hub for sneaker culture—combining real-time data, social features, and a visually stunning, mobile-first experience. The dashboard should feel like a living, breathing marketplace and community.

## Frontend: Creative UI/UX Ideas

### 1. Immersive Visual Design

- **Dynamic Hero Section:** Animated background (e.g., sneaker drops, cityscape, or heatmap pulses)
- **Personalized Greeting:** Show user avatar, name, and a motivational sneaker quote or stat
- **Dark/Light Mode Toggle:** Let users choose their vibe
- **Branding:** Custom iconography, gradients, and micro-interactions (hover, tap, confetti on achievements)

### 2. Interactive Dashboard Widgets

- **Live Drop Heatmap:** Real-time, zoomable map of drop activity with animated pins
- **Sneaker Leaderboard:** Top users by laces, posts, or drop wins (with avatars, badges, and progress bars)
- **Recent Activity Feed:** Infinite scroll of posts, releases, trades, and user actions (with inline media)
- **Quick Actions:** Floating action button for posting, scanning QR codes, or joining live events
- **Upcoming Releases Carousel:** Swipeable cards with countdown timers and RSVP/join buttons
- **Personal Stats:** Animated counters for user’s laces, posts, drops attended, etc.
- **Social Shoutouts:** Highlight trending users, new members, or top contributors

### 3. Social & Gamification Features

- **Achievements & Badges:** Unlockable for milestones (first post, 100 laces, event wins)
- **Streaks:** Daily login, posting, or drop participation streaks with rewards
- **Friend Activity:** See what friends are up to, join their drops, or challenge them
- **Polls & Voting:** Let users vote on next features, releases, or community topics

### 4. Advanced Navigation & Usability

- **Sidebar with Collapsible Sections:** For quick access to Feed, Laces, Dropzones, etc.
- **Search Everywhere:** Global search for users, posts, releases, and locations
- **Notifications Center:** Real-time alerts for drops, DMs, and mentions
- **Accessibility:** Keyboard navigation, screen reader support, high-contrast mode

## Backend: Feature & Data Innovations

### 1. Real-Time & Analytics APIs

- **WebSocket API:** Push live drop events, chat, and notifications to frontend

- **Activity Feed Endpoint:** `/api/dashboard/activity` with filtering (friends, global, by type)
- **Leaderboard Endpoint:** `/api/dashboard/leaderboard` with pagination and filters
- **Heatmap Data Endpoint:** `/api/dashboard/heatmap` with geo-clustering

### 2. Social & Gamification Backend

- **Friends & Follows:** Endpoints for following/unfollowing, friend suggestions, and activity
- **Polls/Voting System:** Backend for community polls, votes, and results
- **Notifications Service:** Store and deliver real-time and historical notifications

### 3. Data Quality & Performance

- **Caching Layer:** Redis or similar for hot dashboard data
- **Background Jobs:** Celery tasks for stats aggregation, notifications, and badge awards
- **API Rate Limiting:** Protect endpoints from abuse
- **Comprehensive Tests:** For all new endpoints and features

### 4. Developer Experience
