# UI/UX Roadmap for Dharma

This document outlines a three-phase plan to elevate the Dharma application's UI/UX to a best-in-class level.

## Phase 1: Design System & Theming

*   **Goal:** Establish a comprehensive and consistent design system.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Theme Definition:** Expand `tailwind.config.ts` to include a full set of design tokens for:
        *   Colors (primary, secondary, accent, semantic colors for success, error, etc.)
        *   Typography (font sizes, weights, line heights)
        *   Spacing (a numeric scale for margins, paddings, gaps)
        *   Radii (a scale for border radiuses)
        *   Shadows (a scale for elevations)
    *   **Component Refactoring:** Refactor all components (starting with `AppShell`, `Sidebar`, and `Topbar`) to use the new design tokens instead of hardcoded values.
    *   **Theming:** Implement a robust theming solution (e.g., using CSS variables) to support light and dark modes.
*   **Effort:** High
*   **Impact:** High

## Phase 2: Layout, Navigation & Motion

*   **Goal:** Improve the application's layout, navigation, and interaction design.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Layout Standardization:** Create a set of standardized layout components (e.g., `Container`, `Grid`, `Stack`) to ensure consistent spacing and alignment.
    *   **Navigation Refinement:** Redesign the `Sidebar` and `Topbar` to be more visually appealing and user-friendly.
    *   **Motion System:** Implement a centralized motion system using Framer Motion to create meaningful and consistent animations.
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High

## Phase 3: Feature Polish, A11y, and Perf

*   **Goal:** Polish key features, ensure accessibility, and optimize performance.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Feature Polish:** Improve the UI/UX of forms, lists, and empty/loading/error states.
    *   **Accessibility Audit:** Conduct a full accessibility audit and address any issues.
    *   **Performance Optimization:** Analyze the bundle size and runtime performance, and implement optimizations as needed.
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium
