# UI/UX Audit Findings for Dharma

## 1. Inventory of Pages, Routes, and Components

*   **Pages/Routes:** The application has a standard set of authenticated routes (`/`, `/heatmap`, `/laces`, `/dropzones`, `/thriftroutes`, `/profile`) and a `/login` page. All authenticated routes are wrapped in an `AppShell` layout.
*   **Key Components:** The core layout is built with `AppShell`, `Sidebar`, and `Topbar`. The application uses shadcn/ui for components like `Button`, `Input`, `DropdownMenu`, etc.
*   **Inconsistencies:**
    *   **Styling:** There is a heavy reliance on hardcoded values for colors, padding, and shadows throughout the layout components. For example, `bg-gray-100`, `p-4`, `shadow-md` are used directly instead of being sourced from a theme.
    *   **Colors:** The `brand` color palette in `tailwind.config.ts` is a good start, but it's not used consistently. The active navigation link in the `Sidebar`, for instance, uses `indigo` instead of the `brand` color.
    *   **Animations:** A generic `transition-all duration-300` is used for the sidebar's open/close animation. This is an ad-hoc animation that should be part of a more comprehensive motion system.

## 2. Design Token Evaluation

*   **Typography:** No explicit typography scale is defined in the Tailwind config.
*   **Spacing:** No explicit spacing scale is defined. Padding values like `p-4` and `md:p-8` are used directly.
*   **Radii & Shadows:** A single `xl` border radius and a `soft` box shadow are defined, but a more comprehensive set of tokens is needed.
*   **Color Tokens:** The `brand` color palette is a good foundation, but it needs to be expanded and applied consistently.

## 3. Accessibility (A11y)

*   **Initial Observations:** The use of `sr-only` for icon buttons is a good practice. However, a full accessibility audit is needed to check for issues with color contrast, focus order, and keyboard navigation.

## 4. Performance

*   **Code Splitting:** The use of `React.lazy` for route-based code splitting is a positive sign for initial page load performance.
*   **Bundle Size:** A bundle analysis would be needed to identify any opportunities for optimization.
